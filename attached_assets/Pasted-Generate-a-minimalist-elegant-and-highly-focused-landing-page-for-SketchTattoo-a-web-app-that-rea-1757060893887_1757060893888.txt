Generate a minimalist, elegant, and highly focused landing page for SketchTattoo, a web app that realistically applies a tattoo to a selected body part in a photo. The page's goal is to immediately capture the attention of tattoo artists and drive them to sign up via email, without any distractions.

Product Overview
Name: SketchTattoo
Functionality: Allows tattoo artists to overlay an image of a tattoo onto a photo of a client's body part, providing a realistic preview of the final result.
Benefits:

Accelerates workflow: Reduces the time needed to create renderings for clients.

Enhances customer retention: Offers clients a clear and professional visualization, increasing trust and satisfaction.

Simplifies the consultation process: Helps the tattoo artist sell the tattoo concept more effectively.

Design and Content Instructions
Overall Style: Minimalist, clean, elegant, and modern. The aesthetic must be refined and professional, reflecting the art of tattooing in a digital key. The entire page should be cohesive, with impeccable visual harmony.

Color Palette: Use a sober and sophisticated palette. I suggest colors like:

Background: Dark or grey tones (e.g., deep black, charcoal grey).

Text: White or light grey for maximum readability.

Accents: A single, elegant, and saturated secondary color, such as dark burgundy, petrol blue, or forest green, to be used strategically for CTAs and details.

Page Structure:
The landing page must be very short and concise, composed only of the following sections:

Header (Above the Fold):

Logo: A PNG image with the product name, SketchTattoo.

Main Visual Element: Under or behind the logo, include a short looping video or an animated GIF (not too heavy) showing a tattoo artist at work with their client in a stylish studio. The animation must be fluid and suggest professionalism and creativity.

Headline: An impactful and concise phrase that immediately communicates the product's value. Examples: "Visualize your next masterpiece" or "The future of tattooing is here."

Sub-headline: A brief sentence that explains the functionality. Ex: "The web app that applies your designs to your clients' bodies in real-time."

Call to Action (CTA): A button or an email sign-up field. The text should be inviting and direct, such as "Join the waitlist" or "Submit your email."

"How It Works" Section:

Animation: An animation (can be a GIF or a mock-up Rive file) that illustrates, in a simple and schematic way, the user's workflow:

Upload a photo of the body.

Upload the tattoo design.

View the realistic result.

The animation must be clean, without frills, and must focus only on the product's functionality. It's a visual preview of the product, not a promotional video.

Static 3-Step Infographic:

Below the animation, create a minimalist infographic consisting of three static icons or illustrations.

Each icon should be accompanied by a title and a brief description to explain the 3 steps of the process, without videos or animations. This reinforces the concept explained in the previous section.

Footer:

An extremely simple footer containing only the logo or product name and, if necessary, a link to "Privacy" or "Terms of Service" (can also be omitted for greater minimalism).

Additional Instructions for Lovable
Priority: The product's clarity must be immediately obvious. The user must understand what it is about within the first 3 seconds.

Reference: Use the landing page https://landio.framer.website/ as a reference point for style, cleanliness, and minimalist design. Analyze how it uses white (or dark) space, typography, and the harmony of elements.

Focus: The only goal of the page is to collect emails. Avoid any other type of CTA or link that could distract the user.
